# Fin or Fate: Choose the Current

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience were you striving to create?
Our project revolves around a fish who serves as the main character of a choose your own adventure story. The overall concept centers around the horizontal movement of the fish throughout the scenes as we view his trials and tribulations throughout. 

## Scenes
**It begins with:**
1.	The fish swimming happily in the ocean
2.	A fishing net swoops in and catches it 
3.	The fish ends up in a bag to be sold at a carnival game and gets won by a young girl
4.	The viewer then gets to choose if the fish ends up in an aquarium or a fishbowl

**If the viewer chooses the fishbowl, the fish gets a sad ending:**


5.	We see the fish sad in a fishbowl in the girl’s bedroom
6.	The fish gets sick and dies overnight
7.	The fish gets flushed down the toilet

**OR**

**If the viewer chooses the aquarium, the fish gets a happy ending:**

5.	We see the fish happy in an aquarium in the girl’s bedroom
6.	The fish finds a partner/ soulmate
7.	They have a baby together and you see their happy family

The experience we were striving to create was centered largely around movement and interaction. We wanted the viewer to have a say in how the story went, while also being able to appreciate the simple yet effective visuals portrayed through the movement and design. Sneheel and QM did the coding for the movement and website layout, but Buka and Sara covered the illustration and design.

# Describe your role and what your contribution was. How did you go about implementing the concept?

##  Sara:
My role was centered on designing the scenes. I designed half, while Buka designed the other half. We chose to go for a simple, cartoon-y, marker-drawn monochrome black-and-white look with a focus on the simplicity of the story— we didn’t want it to be too overwhelming especially since the fish would be moving across the screen. We focused on making the scenes seem comic-like with the textboxes and scene frames, while also adding our own style through the doodling aesthetic we ended up going for. 

We used Procreate to illustrate the scenes and characters.

## Screencaps of the scenes I illustrated (no text):

-	For the sad ending, we had the idea of inverting the colors to match the mood (white to black), which added more to the visual element while also complimenting the funereal symbolism of the moment.

## I also designed the main character:

## For the fish that Buka illustrated, we made it into a PNG, and I illustrated a facial expression pack that we could alternate with depending on the scene.

4. Ocean bubbles on the title page
5. Net that catches the fish in the ocean

##  QM:

My role was coding the website. When I embarked on this project, I aimed to deliver an engaging user experience through seamless horizontal scrolling, captivating visuals, and immersive audio. I worked on creating the basic structure for this website, established the horizontal scrolling functionality, instilled the bubble effect on the first 3 slides, added interactivity through the buttons on the fifth slide, and handpicked as well as integrated the audio elements to complement each slide's theme.

### HTML Structure

The main segments I laid out are:

1. **Audio Control**: A user-friendly icon that serves as a mute/unmute toggle.
2. **Horizontal Scroll Container**: This container houses all the slides, providing an uninterrupted horizontal scroll experience.
3. **Slides**: Individual canvases that I adorned with striking background images and enveloping audio.

**In-depth Look**:
- I chose to use the `background-image` CSS property for depicting the distinct visuals of each slide.
- Each slide is embedded with an `<audio>` tag to play its corresponding sound.
- I added placeholder comments (`<!-- ... -->`) in strategic spots to guide future placement or appending of dynamic elements, such as bubbles.

### CSS Styles I Crafted

### Layout and Design

- I optimized the webpage to stretch across the entire viewport by setting both `body` and `html` to span 100% width and height.
- Ensured a smooth horizontal scrolling experience with `overflow-x: scroll`.
- Each `.slide` has been designed with a consistent width, height, while allowing custom backgrounds and borders.

### Visual Enhancements

- I introduced the `.turn` class to offer a visually pleasing transition between slides.
- The scrollbar aesthetics have been refined to exude elegance, characterized by its slim structure and a chic black thumb.
- Bubbles exhibit a natural floating motion, thanks to the `rise` animation I integrated.
- For intuitive user interaction, the translucent buttons on slides undergo a subtle hue shift upon hover.

### Audio Control Aesthetics

Stationed at the top-right corner, the `.audio-control` defines the appearance of the crucial mute/unmute button, giving users auditory control.

### JavaScript Features I Implemented

### Effortless Scroll with A Twist

- I converted the default vertical scroll behavior into a horizontal one.
- An initial downward scroll gracefully transitions the first slide away, revealing the wonders of the second slide.

### The Magic of Bubbles

To breathe life into the slides, I introduced bubbles that float upwards, creating an immersive underwater experience for users.

#### Implementation Details:

- **HTML**: Each of the first three slides has a `<div class="bubble"></div>` element that acts as a placeholder for the generated bubbles.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Using a `for` loop, I randomly generated a set number of bubbles for each slide.
  - For every bubble, properties like size (`width` and `height`), initial `bottom` position, and `animation-duration` (dictating the ascent speed) were randomly determined within predefined ranges to ensure variety.
- **CSS**:
  - The `.bubble` class defines the basic appearance of bubbles, making them round with a transparent border.
  - The `rise` animation, applied to the bubbles, makes them float upwards until they fade out.

### Interactive Slide Buttons

The fifth slide incorporates interactive buttons that allow users to toggle between different sets of content, adding depth to the narrative.

#### Implementation Details:

- **HTML**: I incorporated two buttons with the classes `.btn-left` and `.btn-right`.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Event listeners were attached to both buttons.
  - Upon a button click, it toggles the visibility of two content sets by manipulating the `display` CSS property or using the `classList.toggle` method.
- **CSS**:
  - Stylish hover effects were added to the buttons to provide feedback on user interaction.
  - The `.active` class changes the appearance of the buttons to indicate which content set is currently being displayed.

### Harmonious Audio Flow

The web experience is accentuated by synchronized audio that responds to the user's navigation through the slides.

#### Implementation Details:

- **HTML**: Each slide is associated with an `<audio>` element containing the source of its respective background sound.
- **JavaScript**:
  - I integrated an `IntersectionObserver` to track when a slide enters or exits the viewport. This way, the audio plays or pauses in tandem with the visibility of its slide.
  - The mute button's event listener toggles the playback of all audios and alters the button's visual indication.
- **CSS**:
  - The `.audio-control` class provides the mute/unmute button's visual representation, with a `toggle` class to swap between the two states.


##  Sneheel:

### Role
For this project, I played two main roles: 
First, I helped direct the creative direction of the illustrations Sara and Buka made (such as framing, animations etc.)
Second, I designed the animation based interactive elements of our code, and finished up our project by bringing together all the elements created by Sara, Buka, and QM, and providing them final touches.

### Concept
Several creative elements of the project initially started off as ideas I provided:
1. Horizontal Scrolling as the maind river of our comic.
2. The fish floating across the initial screens.
3. The moving net catching the fish.
4. The layouts of our panels being in accordance with the left to right horizontal scroll (and using this as a storytelling mechanism)
5. The framing of the carnival, and bedroom scenes.
6. The balloons flying across the screen at the carnival.
7. Several other micro-effects and changes.

### Coding the Animations and Interactivity:

The main elements I coded, and their implementation details are as follows:
1. the fish swimming across the screen in slides 1,2.
   a) I implemented this by adding the fish to slide 2's div, and having it start its movement at an absolute location prior to the start of slide 2 (so it would be over sldie 1 and would cross the panel). The actual movement was acheived using the help of scroll event listeners and adjusting their parameters.
2. The net catching the fish in slide 2.
   a) This was achieved by combining a rotate and translate effect witht the scroll event listener.
3. The balloons in the carnival scene
   a) This was achieved by combining a translate effect witht the scroll event listener.
4. The floating fish on the choice screen, the floating dead fish in the sad ending, and the floating family in the happy ending.
   a) These were acheived by creating a keyframe animation in CSS to help the fish elements up and down.
5. Ensuring that the animations flow smoothly
   a) Due to the bubble animation and the several other moving elements, our website was often stuttering, and slowing down. To solve this I implemented code to ensure that the number of bubbles never increases beyond a fixed value and also fine-tuned chunks of the other code for smoother movements.

### Final Changes

Being the person tasked with the final parts of the project, I had to make several changes under time constraints. These included the following:
1. Recreating the final happy ending slide:
   I realized that without animation the slide would look dull. So I manually rmeoved the family, and used Buka's png of each family member separately for the animation
2. Inverting colors in Slide 4 - Fishbowl.
   I inverted the colors in this sldie to match with the theme in Slides 5 and 6. This was done manually.
3. Layering the seaweed in Slide 1 for a depth effect.
   Together with Buka, I used the seaweed as a new layer to have the fish past behind to create a depth effect.
4. The fish's facial expression changing
   Finally, I also changed the fish's facial expression when it touched the net using a mix of scroll detection and clever code.
5. Organizing the code into directories for a more clean implementation!


# Reflection/Evaluation (initial vs final concept, expectations and goals):

## Sara: 
I was initially worried about how I would illustrate the scenes. Once we agreed on the style and layout, however, things came more naturally, and we were able to storyboard effectively. After I finished a scene, I showed it to my team members in case they had any feedback or felt that modifications needed to be made, which helped clarify the creative vision.

## I had to redesign the carnival scene twice because we weren’t 100% sure about how we wanted it to look, which delayed finalizing it as we reiterated the possible designs:

![Untitled_Artwork 7](https://github.com/saraalmulla03/saraalmulla03.github.io/assets/144206983/90cea585-5b96-48d7-bb25-f6a836d412ce)

We did eventually come up with a solution (Frame 3), which was to change the perspectives completely so that the frame was more centered on the girl rather than the background. This helped tie everything together and make the frame feel and look more cohesive.

## Image references
What helped in producing the scenes was image references. During the illustrative process, I often searched for clipart versions of images I wanted to illustrate, which helped me visualize how I wanted the frames to look (ex. Ferris wheel, carnival tent, fishbowl, toilet) and in turn helped me modify each element to suit our styling.

My expectations and goals were exceeded for this assignment. I think our group worked very well together—we were all on the same page and often agreed with each other, but were still vocal about any changes that needed to be made on the creative or technical side.

##  Buka:
I'm very much satisfied with how our comic website turned out. The incorporation of sound effects and interactive features on each page has not only made the comic engaging but also fun to explore. While I'm proud of what we've done, there's always room for improvement. If we had more time, we could have focused on enhancing user-friendliness. For instance, despite our efforts to include an arrow to guide users in scrolling through the pages, there might still be some confusion for the user. This the lesson I'll carry forward to my future projects, prioritizing user guidance to enhance interaction and the overall experience. During this project, I had an opportunity to learn to create digital art on my iPad which significantly enhanced my visual storytelling skill.
Lastly, my heartfelt thanks go out to my amazing teammates who have created an great website and effectively bringing the story to life.

##  QM:

When I embarked on the journey of developing this website, I was driven by a singular vision: crafting a seamless and interactive website. My objective was to ensure users could navigate without a hitch, taking in the experience rather than getting bogged down by complexities. My coding decisions, from the outset, revolved around this primary goal.

## Initial Concept

In the beginning, I imagined a website that would be more than just visually appealing; it would interact with users, guiding them naturally through its content. I aspired to create something that felt alive, responding to users' actions in intuitive ways.

## Final Product

Reflecting upon the finished product, I can observe how the initial vision evolved and matured:

- **Design and UX**: 
  The visual layout, while initially envisioned as simple, had to be meticulously crafted to ensure intuitive user navigation. It wasn't just about placing elements strategically; it was about anticipating users' expectations and needs. Each button, each transition, and each interactive feature was designed with the user's perspective in mind.

- **Code and Interactivity**:
  My initial pseudocode took on a life of their own as I delved deeper. Each line of code was written, keeping in mind the balance between functionality and user experience. The magic of bubbles, the responsive slide buttons, and the harmonious audio flow all emerged from countless hours of coding, debugging, and refining. My commitment was to ensure that the backend logic seamlessly translated into a frontend experience that felt both magical and natural.

## Expectations and Goals

### What I Set Out To Achieve:
- **User-Centered Interaction**: I wanted users to feel as though the website was conversing with them, guiding them, and responding to their every move.
- **Flawless UX**: Every user should feel comfortable and engaged, never lost or overwhelmed.

### How The Code Reflected This:
- **Code Structure**: I ensured my code was modular and well-documented, making future updates or tweaks more manageable.
- **Responsive Elements**: Ensuring that elements like the bubble effects and slide transitions were smooth required countless iterations and careful calibration in the code.
- **Feedback Loops**: To guarantee users felt acknowledged, I implemented various feedback mechanisms in the code, like subtle animations and audio cues.

## Conclusion

This project was more than just a coding exercise for me; it was a lesson in empathy, patience, and iterative development. While I am proud of the interactive elements and UX flow I achieved, I know every project will bring new lessons. I look forward to the next challenge, armed with the insights I've gathered from this experience.

## Reflection/Evaluation

### Role and Contribution
From our early brainstorming sessions, where I proposed ideas like horizontal scrolling for the comic's primary navigation and floating fish across the starting screens, our project underwent significant evolution. Many of the creative elements I initially introduced, such as the framing of scenes and various micro-effects, were either adjusted or expanded upon. A standout example of this evolution is the alteration of the animation style for the sad ending.

Reflecting on my dual role, I can see how my contributions in creative direction and animation interactivity shaped the project. Guiding the creative nuances of the illustrations and integrating dynamic elements into our code were both challenging and rewarding. As we progressed, it became evident that balancing the creative and technical aspects was crucial. For instance, while introducing the moving net animation or the carnival balloons effect, I had to ensure seamless integration with our story flow.

### Expectations and Goals
When we embarked on this journey, my vision was to create an engaging and interactive comic. And while many of my aspirations, like introducing horizontal scrolling or the depth effect in Slide 1, have been realized, I still see potential for enhancement. I believe the animations can be made even more intricate, and a higher degree of interactivity can be introduced in certain panels. One of the exciting turns in our project was leveraging OpenAI's DallE3 for framing inspiration. Integrating such a groundbreaking tool, especially just after its release, not only boosted our creative output but also kept us at the forefront of technological innovation.

I am immensely proud of how our team collaborated on this project. While we have achieved a lot, I recognize areas for growth. Especially when considering the final touches, like adjusting the fish's facial expressions or optimizing the animation fluidity, there's always room for improvement. Yet, every challenge faced, whether it was the color alterations in Slide 4 or the code organization, was a learning opportunity.
The project's journey, from ideation to realization, has been a profound learning experience. With our collective effort, I'm eagerly anticipating the response from our peers. The thrill of unveiling our creation and gauging its impact fills me with both excitement and curiosity.
